# BlazorAdminPanel

It is a Blazor server app implemented for the demonstration of an admin panel of remote machine service. One can log in to the panel, list machines, sort machines, create a new machine, monitor a machine, update a machine, and delete a machine. During the design of the user interface, the Radzen Blazor library is used. It is originally programmed by using .NET 5 and migrated to .NET 6. To examine Razor pages visually please check the last part of this document.
